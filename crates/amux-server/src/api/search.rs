//! RR-0110 — universal search (FTS5), Invariant 32.
//!
//! `GET /api/search?q=&types=&limit=&offset=` returns ranked, typed hits
//! across board cards (title, desc AND the card log), messages, memories,
//! worker metadata, journal entries and schedules. Net-new: neither the
//! Python server nor the SPA ever had a /api/search.
//!
//! The index itself and the triggers that keep it current live in migration
//! `0013_search.sql` — read its header for why the maintenance is SQL triggers
//! rather than a Rust write hook. This module is the query side plus the two
//! instruments that make a wrong answer visible:
//!
//! - `GET /api/search/status` — per-type index counts vs LIVE source-table
//!   counts, and a `consistent` verdict. An index that quietly stopped being
//!   maintained looks exactly like a corpus with nothing in it, so the only
//!   way "search found nothing" is trustworthy is if drift can be seen
//!   (ethos rule 4). This is also the backfill's count report: the migration
//!   cannot print, this endpoint can.
//! - `POST /api/search/reindex` — rebuild from the source tables, returning
//!   before/after counts per type. The repair, walkable from the sanctioned
//!   tooling (`amux-rs search --reindex`), not a hand-rolled sqlite3 session.
//!
//! Two deliberate design points:
//!
//! **The user's query is never handed to FTS5 raw.** `q` is tokenized here and
//! re-emitted as quoted FTS5 terms. Raw pass-through makes half of ordinary
//! typing (`foo:`, `a-b`, an unbalanced `"`) a 500 from the query parser, and
//! the other half — `NOT`, `*`, column filters — silently means something the
//! typist did not intend. Explicit `"phrases in quotes"` survive; everything
//! else is an AND of terms with a prefix match on the last one.
//!
//! **Highlighting cannot inject markup.** FTS5's `snippet()` is asked to wrap
//! matches in two control characters that cannot occur in indexed text; the
//! whole snippet is then HTML-escaped and ONLY those sentinels become
//! `<mark>`/`</mark>`. A snippet containing `<script>` from a card body comes
//! back escaped, with its match still highlighted.
